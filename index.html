  <h2>My Data Projects</h2>
  
   <ul>
    <li>Measured the relationship between Twitter Sentiment and the United Airline stock prices, using Vader Sentiment analysis: used the beautiful soup library in python to scrap over 3,000,000 tweets from the United Airlines twitter page; performed a Vader Sentiments analysis to generate compound scores for the tweets ranging from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017. My findings showed a very weak correlation between the two variables.
